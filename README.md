## ðŸ”š Conclusion
This repository demonstrates how product pricing, discounting, and customer sentiment (via reviews and ratings) interact across categories. Insights can help inform pricing strategies and identify top-performing product types.
## Key Recommendations:
        1. Optimize Discounts Strategically
Categories with high average discounts may drive traffic but could reduce profitability. Use A/B testing to find the sweet spot between discounts and conversion.

Offer targeted discounts to underperforming but well-rated products to boost visibility without hurting margins.


     2. Invest in Top-Rated Products
Products with high ratings and review counts (e.g., 4.5â˜… and above) are more likely to convert new customers.

Feature these in promoted listings, sponsored ads, and seasonal campaigns.


        3. Revise Low-Engagement Categories
Categories with many products but low total reviews suggest low customer interaction.

Recommendation: Improve product descriptions, images, and incentivize early reviews (within Amazonâ€™s TOS) to boost credibility.


        4. Target High-Potential Products for Upscaling
Products with moderate reviews but high ratings are emerging stars.



           5. Track Rating vs. Discount Trends
Some products with heavy discounts still receive poor ratings.

 Evaluate such products for quality concernsâ€”discounting alone wonâ€™t improve brand image.

6. Price Bucket Strategy
Products priced under â‚¹500 dominate in volume but may yield lower profit per unitExplore upselling tactics or bundle deals to improve average order value.

7. Focus on High-Revenue Categories
Categories with the highest potential revenue (actual price Ã— rating count) should get priority in ad spend, inventory restocking, and regional targeting.
